# CNN-FashionMNIST-Project-Pranto

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
After training on a standard benchmark dataset, the model is evaluated on real-world images captured using a smartphone to analyze model generalization and domain shift.
The complete workflow is fully automated and reproducible using Google Colab and GitHub.

## Dataset Description
Standard Dataset (Training & Testing)

## Fashion-MNIST

60,000 training images

10,000 test images

Image size: 28 × 28 grayscale

10 classes:

        T-shirt/top
        
        Trouser
        
        Pullover
        
        Dress
        
        Coat
        
        Sandal
        
        Shirt
        
        Sneaker
        
        Bag
        
        Ankle boot

The dataset is loaded automatically from CSV files stored in the repository using Git LFS.

Real-World Dataset (Phone Images)

Images captured using a smartphone

## Objects include:

        Shirt
        
        Trouser
        
        Sneaker
        
        Sandal
        
        Bag

Images are resized and converted to grayscale to match Fashion-MNIST format

These images are not used for training, only for testing generalization.

CNN Model Architecture

## The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional Layer (Conv2D + ReLU)

MaxPooling Layer

Second Convolutional Layer

Fully Connected Layers

Output layer with 10 neurons (one per class)

Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
## Optimizer: Adam

The model is implemented using torch.nn.Module.

## Training & Evaluation

The model is trained for multiple epochs on Fashion-MNIST

Training and validation loss and accuracy plots are generated

Performance is evaluated on the standard test set

A confusion matrix is generated to analyze class-wise performance

The notebook executes all steps automatically when Run All is selected in Colab.

## Confusion Matrix (Fashion-MNIST Test Set)

The confusion matrix shows strong diagonal dominance, indicating good classification performance on the standard test dataset.
Most misclassifications occur between visually similar classes such as Shirt and T-shirt/top, which is expected for Fashion-MNIST.

## 📸 Real-World Phone Image Predictions

The trained CNN was tested on real-world images captured using a smartphone.  
The same preprocessing pipeline (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization) was applied.

> **Note:** The percentage shown below each image represents the model’s confidence (softmax probability), not real-world accuracy.

## Accuracy vs Confidence (Important Clarification)

The confidence values shown for real-world images are derived from the softmax output of the CNN and indicate how confident the model is in its prediction, not whether the prediction is correct.

Although confidence values are high, predictions on phone images are often biased toward the “Bag” class. This occurs due to domain shift between:

Fashion-MNIST’s low-resolution, silhouette-style images

Real photographs containing complex backgrounds, lighting, shadows, and textures

This behavior highlights the limitations of models trained on synthetic datasets when applied to real-world data.

## How to Run the Project
